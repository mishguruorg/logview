# Log View

This is an experimental log viewer.

There are three packages:

- [`api`](/packages/api): a server that reads from the database and exposes a GraphQL API,
- [`cli`](/packages/cli): a command line tool that displays logs in the terminal.
- [`web`](/packages/web): a web app that displays logs in the browser
